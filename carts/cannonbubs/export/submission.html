<p>Shoot down enemy planes with hard or fast projectiles</p>
<!-- BREAK -->

<p>Shoot down enemy planes. Your projectiles are <em>hard</em> and <em>fast</em> - just not at the same time. </p>
<p>Cannonballs are slow but can destroy planes. Bubbles are fast and don't do damage, but they can move cannonballs off course.</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<ul>
<li>Arrow Keys to move your plane</li>
<li>Z to shoot bubble</li>
<li>X to shoot cannonball</li>
<li>P to pause (used to reset if you die)</li>
</ul>
